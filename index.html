  <h1>Finally, a table!</h1>
  <h3>Table Description</h3>
    <p>This is my table with all of the Top Pot Donuts data. It took a very long time to get all the data to actually show up in the table. As you can see in my code, I had an even more confusing time trying to get the totals numbers to display. I ended up having to get my script to total the numbers down in my final for loops instead of having a method up top that worked. Will talk to TA's about this, and how to fix. But in my current rendition I do have final totals working.
  <table>
    <thead>
      <th>Location</th>
      <th>7 A.M.</th>
      <th>8 A.M.</th>
      <th>9 A.M.</th>
      <th>10 A.M.</th>
      <th>11 A.M.</th>
      <th>12 P.M.</th>
      <th>1 P.M.</th>
      <th>2 P.M.</th>
      <th>3 P.M.</th>
      <th>4 P.M.</th>
      <th>5 P.M.</th>
      <th>6 P.M.</th>
      <th>Totals</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody id='table'>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <script type='text/javascript' src='donut.js'></script>
</body>
