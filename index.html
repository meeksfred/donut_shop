  <h1>Finally, a table!</h1>
  <h3>Table Description</h3>
    <p>This is my table with all of the Top Pot Donuts data. It took a very long time to get all the data to actually show up in the table. As you can see in my code, I had an even more confusing time trying to get the totals numbers to display. I ended up having to get my script to total the numbers down in my final for loops instead of having a method up top that worked. Will talk to TA's about this, and how to fix. But in my current rendition I do have final totals working.
